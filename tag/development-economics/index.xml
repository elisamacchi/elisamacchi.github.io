      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do visible wealth signals have instrumental benefits in low-information settings? I tackle this question experimentally by investigating the wealth signaling power and the instrumental economic benefits of obesity in the urban area of Kampala, Uganda. In low-resource contexts obesity is akin to a status good. Using photo-morphed pictures of real Kampala residents, I show that obesity is perceived as a strong and reliable wealth signal. To test for benefits, I cooperate with 124 small financial institutions in Kampala. In an incentivized field experiment I show that obese borrowers have easier access to credit, because loan officers exploit obesity as a wealth signal. Going from normal weight to obese improves access to credit as much as increasing one&amp;rsquo;s income by 60 percent. I pinpoint the mechanism by showing that reducing asymmetric information reduces the obesity premium by 70 percent.  Although loan officers appear to engage in statistical discrimination, I provide suggestive evidence that most loan officers hold biased beliefs about the income distribution by body mass. A final experiment shows that the benefits of obesity are commonly known, but generally overestimated. I discuss implication for anti-discrimination and obesity prevention policies.&lt;/p&gt;
