      <title>Worth your weight? Experimental evidence on the benefits of obesity in low-income countries.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT: In low-resource settings, where asymmetric information is widespread and verification technologiesare lacking, visible status goods may be exploited as cheap wealth screening devices. Obesity
is visible, and in most low- income countries has the characteristics of a status good. In this paper,
I test experimentally whether obesity has monetary benefits because it is exploited as a signal of
wealth. To explore benefits I focus on credit markets. I estimate the causal effect of obesity by
randomly assigning body mass using photo-morphed pictures in loan applications. The setting is
Kampala, Uganda. In a field experiment with 124 financial institutions, I show that going from normal
weight to obese improves access to credit as much as increasing one’s income by 60 percent. I
pinpoint the mechanism by showing that reducing asymmetric information reduces obesity benefits.
In terms of welfare consequences, a model of credit discrimination suggests that loan officers overrespond to obesity as compared to an unbiased discrimination benchmark. Further experimental
evidence shows that lay people anticipate and overestimate obesity benefits, leading to additional
demand distortions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EU transfers and euroscepticism: can&#39;t buy me love?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT: The future of an institution, such as the European Union, ultimately depends on people’s
support. This paper investigates whether EU redistributive policies have improved
public attitudes towards European integration, both in terms of public opinion and political
preferences. We focus on Cohesion Policy funds, whose allocation allows us to single out
these effects by means of a regression discontinuity approach. The results show that EU
transfers have mitigated the rise of Eurosceptical attitudes and reduced political consensus
for anti-EU parties. The effects are homogeneous across different socio-economic groups,
including the most disadvantaged ones. The improvement in public support for the EU does
not appear to be exclusively a spillover of the positive economic effect of funding; we show
evidence suggesting the existence of a &amp;lsquo;reciprocity-effect&amp;rsquo; channel, i.e. citizens in recipient
regions recognize the beneficial role of the EU as the source of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
