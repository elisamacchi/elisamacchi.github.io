      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The future of an institution, such as the European Union, ultimately depends on peopleâ€™s
support. This paper investigates whether EU redistributive policies have improved
public attitudes towards European integration, both in terms of public opinion and political
preferences. We focus on Cohesion Policy funds, whose allocation allows us to single out
these effects by means of a regression discontinuity approach. The results show that EU
transfers have mitigated the rise of Eurosceptical attitudes and reduced political consensus
for anti-EU parties. The effects are homogeneous across different socio-economic groups,
including the most disadvantaged ones. The improvement in public support for the EU does
not appear to be exclusively a spillover of the positive economic effect of funding; we show
evidence suggesting the existence of a &amp;lsquo;reciprocity-effect&amp;rsquo; channel, i.e. citizens in recipient
regions recognize the beneficial role of the EU as the source of funding.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
