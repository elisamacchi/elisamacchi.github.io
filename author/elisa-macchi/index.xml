      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper provides novel experimental evidence on the wealth-signaling value and associated financial benefits of obesity in a low-resource setting. My empirical strategy leverages two experiments, which randomly assign obesity using weight-manipulated portraits. First, I show that residents of Kampala (Uganda) perceive obesity as a reliable signal of wealth (vs other traits, such as beauty or health). Second, I show that the wealth-signaling value of obesity translates into financial benefits, namely easier access to credit. In a real-stake experiment with 124 Kampala credit institutions, I find that professional loan officers screen borrowers based on body mass. Obese borrowers have easier access to credit: moving from normal weight to obese is equivalent to increasing one&amp;rsquo;s income by 60%. I shed light on the mechanism by showing that reducing the asymmetric information strongly reduces the obesity premium. While these results are consistent with standard screening mechanisms, I also find suggestive evidence of deviations from the rational-expectations benchmark. Loan officers hold inaccurate beliefs about the borrowers&amp;rsquo; conditional income distribution by body mass, and appear to favor obese borrowers to an inefficient extent. On the borrowers&amp;rsquo; side, I show that obesity benefits are commonly known (and significantly overestimated). I discuss implications for credit provision and obesity prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
